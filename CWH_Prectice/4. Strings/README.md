# Strings

* Written in the **double quotes**:
```js
const hello = "Hello";
```


* Can be access using **index number**:
```js
const myName = "Arbaz";

console.log(myName[3]) //Output: a
```


* Strings are **immutable**:
```js
const myName = "Arbaz Khan";

myName[5] = "-"  //‚ùå Cannot mutate
```


* Strings behave like **array of charactors** but it is **not array of charactors**:
