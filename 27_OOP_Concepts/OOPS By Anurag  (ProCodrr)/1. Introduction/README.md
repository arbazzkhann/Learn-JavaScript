# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
OOPs is a **programming method** that is based on the concept of "objects", which contain data and code to operate on the data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use OOPs?
* Organizes code better
* Makes code reusable (via inheritance)
* Easier to maintain and update
* Helps in building large and complex software


## There are four pillars of OOPs:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polimorphism


1. Encapsulation:
* **Hiding data** using **classes** and providing access via methods.
* Example: Private data in a class, accessed through getter/setter methods.

2. Abstraction:
* **Showing only important details** 
* **hiding the complex part**.
* Example: You use a TV remote without knowing how it works inside.

3. Inheritance:
* One class (child) can **inherit features from another class** (parent).
* Example: Dog class can inherit from Animal class.

4. Polimorphism (Many Forms):
* One thing **behaves differently** in different situations.
* Example: A function with the **same name** but **different behavior** based on input.
